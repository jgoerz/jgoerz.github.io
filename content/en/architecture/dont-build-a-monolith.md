An [informative presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHQH4zuR58I) by
Jonathan Tower.  Once a distributed monolith is in place, the company culture
has most likely accepted it as a _good architecture_. Convincing **leadership**
and the team to _improve_ it requires a paradigm and/or culture shift.
